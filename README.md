This is some of the source codes for the paper "Anonymous Hedonic Game for Task Allocation in a Large-Scale Multiple Agent System" in IEEE T-RO ([DOI: 10.1109/TRO.2018.2858292](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8439076))

Basically, each figure shows a decentralised process of multiple robots (n_a = 320) for task allocation (n_t = 5). Here, the circles and the squares indicate the positions of the robots and the tasks, respectively. The lines between the circles represent the communication networks of the robots. 
The colored robots are assigned to the same colored task; for example, yellow robots belong to the team for executing the yellow task. The size of a square indicates the reward of the corresponding task. The cost for a robot with regard to a task is considered as a function of
the distance from the robot to the task.

For more details, please refer to the paper.
